This is the code for the manuscript entitled "Bridging deep learning force fields and electronic structures with a physics-informed approach."

The folder "force_input" generates the input for the force field model.

The folder "force_model" contains the code for training the force field model.

The folder "hamiltonian_input" generates the input for the Wannier Hamiltonian model.
'mm' means interactions between Mo and Mo.
'ms' means interactions between Mo and S.
'sm' means interactions between S and Mo.
'ss' means interactions between S and S.
The Wannier Hamiltonian elements are divided into three categories
(1) intra-layer hopping integrals. 
    atomic-pair length within 6 angstroms and out of 6 angstroms are trained with different models, as "intra_near" and "intra_long"(2) inter-layer hopping integrals.
    as in the folders "inter", "inter_ss_near", and "inter_ss_long"
(3) on-site interactions
    as in the folders 'self_m', 'self_s'

The folder "hamiltonian_input" generates the input for training the Wannier Hamiltonian elements.

The folder "electronic_band" shows an example about how to use the current model to generate the band structure of a twisted bi-layer MoS2 composed of 201 atoms.
